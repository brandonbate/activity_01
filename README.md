# In-Class Activity #1

This activity has you review basic Python. I recommend using the following websites to help with this review:

- [W3 Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/))

To get started, you'll need to create a folder to store this activity. I used the folder name ```in_class_01_python_review```.
Add functions to ```review.py``` to satisfy the tests in ```review_test.py```.
